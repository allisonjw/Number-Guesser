# Number-Guesser
## Created by Allison Wagner & Elyse Myers
### Summary
This is the second project of Module 1 at the Turing School of Software & Design. Number Guesser is a project that focuses on continuing to develop the skills of writing semantic HTML, clean & organized CSS and DRY JavaScript. It also introduces the concepts of DOM manipulation and modifying elements after the page has loaded.

Number Guesser is a number guessing game in which two players can define a min and max range to guess within and then enter their name and subsequent guesses. When the player submits a guess they receive feedback via a message below their guessed number to let them know if their guess was too high, too low or correct. To improve user experience error states have been implemented on all of the input fields. Users will know if their range is valid and also if they have left any fields blank that will prevent them from playing the game. When a player wins a card is generated on the right side of the screen announcing the winner.

Number guess is responsive down to px. Using the appropriate media queries you can play this game on desktop or mobile. View this application live on github pages here and play on your phone!
